### Overview

![Overview](overview.png)

### Research Challenges
> #### Statistical Heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneity refers to the case where the data distribution across clients in federated learning is inconsistent and does not obey the same sampling, i.e., Non-IID.

![Statistical Heterogeneity](statis_hetero.png)

> #### Model Heterogeneity
Model heterogeneity refers to the fact that in federated learning, participating clients may have local models with different architectures.

> #### Communication Heterogeneity
The devices are typically deployed in different network environments and have different network connectivity settings (3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi), which leads to inconsistent communication bandwidth, latency, and reliability, i.e., communication heterogeneity.

> #### Device Heterogeneity
The differences in device hardware capabilities (CPU, memory, battery life) may lead to different storage and computation capabilities, which inevitably lead to device heterogeneity.

> #### Additional Challenges

    FedEval is a federated learning evaluation model with five metrics including accuracy, communication, time consumption, privacy and robustness. FedEval is implemented and evaluated on two of the most widely used algorithms, FedSGD and FedAvg.
  
2. **Specific Federated Learning Systems**
- **FedReIDBench** — [Performance Optimization of Federated Person Re-identification via Benchmark Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394171.3413814) *ACM MM 2020*

    FedReIDBench is a new benchmark for implementing federated learning to person ReID, which includes nine different datasets and two federated scenarios. Specifically, the two federated scenarios are federated-by-camera scenario and federated-by-dataset scenario, which respectively represent the standard server-client architecture and client-edge-cloud architecture.

- **pFL-Bench** — [pFL-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Personalized Federated Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/3cc03e19fed71a2b9347d83921ca2e7d-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html) *NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track*

    pFL-Bench is a benchmark for personalized federated learning, which covers twelve different dataset variants, including image, text, graph and recommendation data, with unified data partitioning and realistic heterogeneous settings. And pFL-Bench provides more than 20 competitive personalized federated learning baseline implementations to help them with standardized evaluation.

- **FedGraphNN** — [FedGraphNN: A Federated Learning System and Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07145) *ICLR 2021 Workshop on DPML*

    FedGraphNN is a benchmark system built on a unified formulation of graph federated learning, including extensive datasets from seven different fields, popular Graph Neural Network (GNN) models and federated learning algorithms.

3. **Datasets**
- **LEAF** — [LEAF: A Benchmark for Federated Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01097) *NeurIPS 2019 Workshop*

    LEAF contains 6 types of federated datasets covering different fields, including image classification (FEMNIST, Synthetic Dataset), image recognition (Celeba), sentiment analysis (Sentiment140) and next character prediction (Shakespeare, Reddit). In addition, LEAF provides two sampling methods of 'IID' and 'Non-IID' to divide the dataset to different clients.

- **Street Dataset** — [Real-World Image Datasets for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11089) *FL-NeurIPS 2019*

    This work introduces a federated dataset for object detection. The dataset contains over 900 images generated from 26 street cameras and 7 object categories annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Besides, the article provides the data division of 5 or 20 clients, in which their data distribution is Non-IID and unbalanced, reflecting the characteristics of real-world federated learning scenarios.
